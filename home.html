    <p>My project focuses on the area of African American experience throughout the United States has never been great. However, to understand the significance of the African American experience, it is necessary to dive deep into the sociology of African American experiences throughout US history and in the contemporary world. This involves discussing the disparities and their effects on society. This discussion should cut across historical contexts and develop to illustrate the current state of the disparities. To facilitate the discussion, this project paper seeks to comprehensively analyze clear segregation in two schools in Onondaga County, New York.
