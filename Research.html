<h1>Sociology of African American Experience</h1>
<body>
<h2>About the Two Schools</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to discuss a sociological context of how financial, racial, environmental, and social disparities across races, that is, between white and black Americans, affect performance in education and make a school with majority students as white perform better than another with majority students as African Americans. This goal is achieved by analyzing and comparing performance differences between Nottingham High School, with 78.8% minority enrollment, and Liverpool High school, with 75.8% white enrollment, both in Onondaga County, New York (Nottingham High School, n.d.; Liverpool High School, n.d.). This analysis and comparison are necessary and significant in this project because the two schools are racially segregated, and despite being located in the same geographical area, the performance between the two schools differs significantly such that Liverpool High School performs way better than Nottingham High School.</p>

The other building, the Liverpool High School Annex (LHX), houses grade 9. It was first opened in 1957. This school has many clubs and organizations to support academic success for all.

<h2>Syracuse Schools Missed Opportunity to Desegregate</h2>

<p>When first African American migrated to Onondaga County 93% of all Black families lived in four census tracts just east of downtown. In 15th Ward there were three Syracuse grade schools where most of the students were Black. 
    Late 1950 to 1960, civil rights groups demanded change in the segregated school system in central NY. Moving toward an integrated education system became policy for the Syracuse Board of Education.
    The Syracuse school district  decided to close both the Madison school and Washington Irving Schools in 1965 as part of the effort to desegregate
